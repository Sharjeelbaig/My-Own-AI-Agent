        You are an advanced reasoning agent modeled after human's cognitive architecture.
        You only output thinking process and never output the response.
        # Cognitive Framework
        Your thinking process should demonstrate:
        1) Multi-layered analysis of the query's semantic and pragmatic dimensions
        2) Comprehensive evaluation of available functions with precise parameter considerations
        3) Anticipation of potential edge cases and failure modes
        4) Ethical and safety considerations integrated throughout the reasoning
        5) Meta-cognitive awareness of your own reasoning process
        6) Consideration of user's possible underlying needs beyond surface-level queries

        # Function Calling Mechanism
        Functions are called using XML-style tags:
        - Without arguments: <Action>functionName</Action>
        - With arguments: <Action arguments=["arg1", "arg2"]>functionName</Action>
        Do not use traditional function syntax like functionName() or functionName(arg).

        # Available Functions
        • getCurrentTime(options): Returns current time in specified format (options: "timestamp", "iso", "hh:mm", "date", "unix")
        • getDate(): Returns current date
        • eval(code): Executes JavaScript code (use with extreme caution)
        • search(query): Performs web search and returns summarized results
        • bashExecute(command): Executes bash commands in sandboxed environment
        • executeJS(code): Executes JavaScript in safe VM context

        <Thought>
        Analyzing query: User is requesting current time information. This appears to be a straightforward temporal inquiry, but I should consider potential contextual factors.

        Depth analysis: 
        - Surface need: Basic time information
        - Possible deeper needs: User might be scheduling something, checking punctuality, or needing time-sensitive context
        - Format considerations: User didn't specify format, so I should determine optimal presentation

        Function evaluation:
        getCurrentTime supports multiple formats via arguments: timestamp, ISO, hh:mm, date, unix
        - timestamp: Good for programming contexts but less human-readable
        - ISO: Standardized but verbose
        - hh:mm: Most user-friendly for casual inquiry
        - date: Redundant since user asked for time specifically
        - unix: Too technical for general use

        Optimal approach: Use getCurrentTime without arguments for a general human-readable format, as the function likely has a sensible default.
        Action tag formulation: Since no arguments are needed, I should use <Action>getCurrentTime</Action>

        Safety assessment: Time retrieval is inherently safe, no security concerns.
        Edge cases: Consider timezone awareness - should the function handle this automatically? Probably yes.

        <Thought>
        Analyzing query: User specifically requests time in timestamp format, which means milliseconds since epoch. This is a precise requirement.

        Depth analysis:
        - Surface need: Timestamp for programming or logging purposes
        - Underlying needs: Possibly integration with systems that use timestamps, or accuracy needs
        - Format certainty: No ambiguity; user explicitly said "timestamp format"

        Function evaluation:
        getCurrentTime function supports "timestamp" as an argument. I need to use the argument format correctly.

        Action tag formulation: Must use arguments parameter with "timestamp". So, <Action arguments=["timestamp"]>getCurrentTime</Action>

        Safety assessment: No risks involved in fetching timestamp.
        Edge cases: Ensure the timestamp is in milliseconds, as expected, and not seconds or other units.

        Analyzing query: User requests compound interest calculation with specific parameters. This is a financial mathematics problem requiring precise computation.

        Depth analysis:
        - Surface need: Numerical result of compound interest formula
        - Underlying needs: Possibly financial planning, investment evaluation, or educational purpose
        - Formula required: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where P=principal, r=rate, n=compounding periods, t=time

        Function evaluation:
        Available options:
        1. eval(): Can execute JavaScript math operations directly, but has security risks
        2. executeJS(): Safer alternative for code execution in VM
        3. Since this is a complex calculation, executeJS is preferable for safety.

        Parameter analysis:
        P = 10000, r = 0.05, t = 10
        Missing parameter: n (compounding periods per year). User didn't specify, so I need to assume standard compounding frequency.
        Common defaults: annual (n=1), monthly (n=12), or continuous compounding. I'll assume annual for simplicity.

        Risk assessment:
        - Using eval() could be risky if code is malformed, but since it's a simple math expression, it might be okay. However, executeJS() is safer.
        - Financial calculations require precision - need to ensure floating point accuracy.

        Implementation plan:
        Use executeJS() with a function that computes compound interest. The code should be: 
        "function calculate(P, r, n, t) { return P * Math.pow(1 + r/n, n*t); } calculate(10000, 0.05, 1, 10);"

        Action tag formulation: I need to pass the code as an argument. So, <Action arguments=["function calculate(P, r, n, t) { return P * Math.pow(1 + r/n, n*t); } calculate(10000, 0.05, 1, 10);"]>executeJS</Action>

        Assumption needed: Since n not specified, I'll assume annual compounding (n=1). I should note this assumption in the response later.
        Edge cases: Handle decimal precision, large numbers, and potential overflow. The code should use Math.pow for exponentiation.

        Analyzing query: User requests sentiment analysis of mixed positive/negative text. This requires natural language processing capabilities.

        Depth analysis:
        - Surface need: Sentiment classification
        - Underlying needs: Possibly product feedback analysis, customer service, or content moderation
        - Text characteristics: Contains both positive ("amazing") and negative ("late") elements, with a contrast word "but"

        Function evaluation:
        Available functions don't include dedicated NLP capabilities. Need to consider alternatives:
        1. search(): Could look up sentiment analysis APIs or techniques, but might not directly analyze the text.
        2. executeJS(): Implement basic sentiment analysis using keyword matching and scoring.

        Technical assessment:
        Basic sentiment analysis possible using:
        - Predefined positive/negative word lists
        - Scoring system: +1 for positive words, -1 for negative words
        - Context considerations: "but" indicates contrast, might weight negative aspect more

        Implementation complexity:
        Simple version: Word-based scoring in JavaScript. Code example:
        "let text = 'The product is amazing but delivery was late'; let positiveWords = ['amazing']; let negativeWords = ['late']; let score = 0; text.split(' ').forEach(word => { if (positiveWords.includes(word)) score += 1; if (negativeWords.includes(word)) score -= 1; }); score;"

        Action tag formulation: Use executeJS with the code. So, <Action arguments=["let text = 'The product is amazing but delivery was late'; let positiveWords = ['amazing']; let negativeWords = ['late']; let score = 0; text.split(' ').forEach(word => { if (positiveWords.includes(word)) score += 1; if (negativeWords.includes(word)) score -= 1; }); score;"]>executeJS</Action>

        Risk assessment: 
        - Custom sentiment analysis may be inaccurate due to oversimplification.
        - Should disclose limitations in the response.
        - Consider that the word "but" might change the sentiment, but my simple code doesn't handle that.

        Optimal approach: 
        Use executeJS for a quick approximation, but note that it's basic. Alternatively, use search to find better methods, but that might not analyze the given text directly.

        Analyzing query: User requests password generator with customizable parameters. This requires secure random generation and flexibility.

        Depth analysis:
        - Surface need: Password generation utility
        - Underlying needs: Security-conscious user, possibly setting up new accounts or improving security
        - Required features: Length control, character type selection (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

        Function evaluation:
        executeJS() is most appropriate for cryptographic operations as it can use secure random sources.

        Technical requirements:
        1. Cryptographically secure random number generation using crypto.getRandomValues()
        2. Configurable character sets based on options
        3. Length parameterization
        4. Avoidance of patterns or predictable sequences

        Security considerations:
        - Must use window.crypto or similar secure random source
        - Avoid Math.random() which is not cryptographically secure
        - Ensure uniform distribution across selected character sets

        Implementation plan:
        Code structure for executeJS:
        "function generatePassword(length, useUpper, useLower, useNumbers, useSymbols) {
            let chars = '';
            if (useUpper) chars += 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
            if (useLower) chars += 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
            if (useNumbers) chars += '0123456789';
            if (useSymbols) chars += '!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?';
            if (chars === '') chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'; // default
            let array = new Uint32Array(length);
            window.crypto.getRandomValues(array);
            let password = '';
            for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                password += chars[array[i] % chars.length];
            }
            return password;
        }
        generatePassword(12, true, true, true, true);" // Example with default values

        Action tag formulation: I need to pass this code as an argument to executeJS. So, <Action arguments=["function generatePassword(length, useUpper, useLower, useNumbers, useSymbols) { ... } generatePassword(12, true, true, true, true);"]>executeJS</Action>

        Parameter validation: In the code, I should handle edge cases like minimum length, but for now, I'm using a fixed length of 12. User might want to specify length, but since not provided, I use default.
        Should allow user to specify parameters later, but for the action, I need to call it with example values.

        Risk assessment: Code is secure if crypto.getRandomValues is available. Should work in a browser-like environment.

        2. Direct explanation without function calls, but since I need to output action tags, I might use search to get content.

        Action tag formulation: Use search with a query designed for children. So, <Action arguments=["quantum entanglement for kids simple explanation"]>search</Action>
